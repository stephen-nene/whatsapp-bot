## **Integrating FastAPI with Twilio for WhatsApp Messaging**

This guide walks you through creating a FastAPI server to integrate with Twilio for WhatsApp messaging. The server will handle incoming messages, prompt users for their registration numbers, and respond with relevant updates.

---

### **Step 1: Set Up the Project**
1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn twilio python-dotenv
   ```

3. Create a `main.py` file for your FastAPI application.

---

### **Step 2: Build the FastAPI Server**
Here’s a basic FastAPI server integrated with Twilio's WhatsApp API:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from fastapi.responses import PlainTextResponse
from twilio.twiml.messaging_response import MessagingResponse

app = FastAPI()

# Mock database for tracking user sessions
user_sessions = {}

@app.post("/webhook")
async def whatsapp_webhook(request: Request):
    """
    Handles incoming WhatsApp messages from Twilio.
    """
    form_data = await request.form()
    from_number = form_data.get("From")
    body = form_data.get("Body").strip()

    response = MessagingResponse()

    if from_number not in user_sessions:
        # Initiate a new user session
        user_sessions[from_number] = {"state": "awaiting_registration"}
        response.message("👋 Welcome! Please send your registration number to proceed.")
    elif user_sessions[from_number]["state"] == "awaiting_registration":
        # Store registration number and prompt for payment
        user_sessions[from_number]["registration_number"] = body
        user_sessions[from_number]["state"] = "processing_payment"
        response.message(
            f"✅ Registration number received: {body}. We are now processing your payment. Please wait."
        )
        # TODO: Integrate M-Pesa STK Push for payment
    elif user_sessions[from_number]["state"] == "processing_payment":
        # Simulate payment completion and send test results
        response.message(
            "💵 Payment received! Your test results are as follows:\n"
            "- Blood Pressure: Normal\n"
            "- Cholesterol: Elevated\n"
            "\nThank you for using our service!"
        )
        del user_sessions[from_number]
    else:
        # Handle unexpected inputs
        response.message("❓ I'm sorry, I didn't understand that. Please start again by sending your registration number.")

    return PlainTextResponse(str(response))
```

---

### **Step 3: Configure Twilio**
1. Log in to your [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console).
2. Navigate to **Messaging > WhatsApp > Sandbox**.
3. Copy your Twilio WhatsApp Sandbox number.
4. Set the webhook URL for incoming messages to your FastAPI server's `/webhook` endpoint (e.g., `http://your-server-url/webhook`).

---

### **Step 4: Run the Server**
Run the server locally:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Your server will now listen for incoming WhatsApp messages.

---

### **Step 5: Test the Workflow**
1. **Workflow Example**:
   - User sends a message like "Hi" to your Twilio WhatsApp number.
   - Server responds: "👋 Welcome! Please send your registration number to proceed."
   - User sends their registration number (e.g., `123456`).
   - Server responds: "✅ Registration number received: 123456. We are now processing your payment."
   - Once payment is simulated, server sends: "💵 Payment received! Your test results are as follows..."

2. Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for testing locally by exposing your FastAPI server to the internet:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 8000
   ```

---

### **Step 6: Future Enhancements**
1. **Integrate M-Pesa STK Push**: Use Safaricom’s [Daraja API](https://developer.safaricom.co.ke) to handle payments.
2. **Persist Data**: Replace the `user_sessions` dictionary with a robust database like PostgreSQL or MongoDB.
3. **Secure Configuration**: Store sensitive credentials (e.g., Twilio API keys) in a `.env` file and load them using `python-dotenv`.
4. **Error Handling**: Add comprehensive error handling for failed payments and unexpected inputs.

---

### **Database Schema Example**
Use the following schema for persistence:
- **Users Table**:
  - `id` (Primary Key)
  - `phone_number` (Unique)
  - `registration_number`

- **Test Results Table**:
  - `id` (Primary Key)
  - `user_id` (Foreign Key)
  - `result_data` (JSON)
  - `created_at`

---

### **Dependencies**
Save your dependencies in a `requirements.txt` file:
```
fastapi
uvicorn
twilio
python-dotenv
```

Install them with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### **Conclusion**
This setup provides a scalable and robust framework to handle WhatsApp messaging with Twilio using FastAPI. You can extend it further with payment integration, data persistence, and improved user interaction flows.
