# Government Services AI Bot

## Overview

The **Government Services AI Bot** is a conversational AI system designed to help users access a variety of government services directly through their phones. Built using **Twilio**, **xAI's Grok model**, and **M-Pesa STK Push**, the bot facilitates real-time interactions with government services like checking KCSE results, verifying national IDs, querying vehicle registrations, and more.

The bot integrates with government databases, providing real-time data while offering users a simple, interactive interface. It can also process payments via M-Pesa, making it a complete solution for accessing, interacting with, and paying for government services.

## Features

- **Query Government Services**: Query multiple government services such as KCSE results, land ownership, driving license status, vehicle registration, and more.
- **M-Pesa STK Push**: Seamlessly make payments for government services (e.g., fines, licenses) directly through the bot.
- **Grok AI Integration**: Use Grok for advanced conversational capabilities, including dynamic responses to user queries.
- **Admin Notifications**: Admins are notified of unusual or out-of-scope questions for continuous improvement.
- **Real-Time Database Queries**: Connect to government databases (mocked for development) to fetch real-time data.

## Technologies Used

- **Twilio**: For handling SMS and WhatsApp-based interactions.
- **xAI Grok**: For intelligent conversational AI responses.
- **M-Pesa STK Push**: For processing payments.
- **Node.js**: For backend API and server logic.
- **Express**: For handling RESTful API routes.
- **PostgreSQL**: For storing user data and query history.
- **Sequelize**: For ORM to interact with the PostgreSQL database.
- **dotenv**: For environment variable management.

## Requirements

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/) (for SMS/WhatsApp interaction)
- [xAI Grok API key](https://x.ai/)
- [M-Pesa API credentials](https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/m-pesa-safaricom)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/government-services-ai-bot.git
   cd government-services-ai-bot
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API credentials:
   ```bash
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
   XAI_API_KEY=your_xai_api_key
   MPESA_SHORTCODE=your_mpesa_shortcode
   MPESA_LIPA_NA_MPESA_SHORTCODE=your_lipa_na_mpesa_shortcode
   DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_database_url
   ```

4. Run database migrations (if needed):
   ```bash
   npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
   ```

5. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Running Locally

To run the bot locally, use a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your local server to the internet. Then, configure Twilio to send webhooks to your ngrok URL.

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

Update the webhook URL in your Twilio console with the URL generated by ngrok.

## API Endpoints

### **POST /api/query**

This endpoint allows users to interact with the bot by sending a query. It returns the relevant government service information or initiates an M-Pesa payment.

#### Request Body:
```json
{
  "phone_number": "+254711XXXXXXX",
  "message": "What is my KCSE result?"
}
```

#### Response:
```json
{
  "response": "To check your KCSE results, send your index number to 20076 via SMS or visit [link]."
}
```

## Admin Dashboard

For administrators, the bot provides an interface where they can:

- View all incoming queries.
- Identify out-of-context queries that need further action.
- Manage and track user interactions and payments.

## Grok Model Customization

The bot uses xAI's Grok model for natural language understanding. You can fine-tune Grok to be more context-aware, or adjust its behavior by modifying the `messages` array in the Grok API request.

Example API Request:
```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are an AI bot designed to help users with government services in Kenya."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "How do I check my KCSE results?"
    }
  ],
  "model": "grok-beta",
  "stream": false,
  "temperature": 0
}
```
